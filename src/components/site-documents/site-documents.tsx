                            projects using the play button on the project as
                            well as select the project to view/edit the project

                        <h2>Creating a New Project</h2>

                        <p>
                            On your profile page, use the &quot;Create +&quot;
                            button to create a new project. A modal dialog will
                            appear where you can fill in the name of the
                            project, description, and any tags. You can later
                            edit the project information using the
                            &quot;Edit&quot; button. The name, description and
                            tags will be visible for the project on your profile
                            page for you and others who may look at your profile
                            (if your project is public). These fields will also
                            be used when users search for projects.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Editing a Project</h2>

                        <img
                            src="img/project_editor.png"
                            alt="Project Editor"
                            width="100%"
                        ></img>

                        <p>
                            The project editor is made up of a number of
                            components:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Menu Bar</li>
                            <li>Project File Tree</li>
                            <li>File Editors</li>
                            <li>Console Output</li>
                            <li>Play Controls</li>
                            <li>Social Controls</li>
                            <li>
                                Csound Manual Panel (not shown in screenshot
                                above)
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Menu Bar</h3>

                        <p>
                            The menu bar contains dropdown menus for various
                            operations in the Web-IDE such as saving files,
                            opening and closing views (i.e., Project File Tree,
                            Console Ouptput, Csound Manual Panel), and more.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Project File Tree</h3>

                        <p>
                            Projects are made up of files laid out in a
                            directory structure much like they would be when
                            working with Csound on a desktop operating system.
                            Click on a file in the file tree to open up its
                            editor. Organize your code and resource files and
                            use relative paths in the same way as you would if
                            using Csound on the desktop.
                        </p>

                        <h3>File Editors</h3>

                        <p>
                            Editors appear for editing code and working with
                            resource files. Code editors provide syntax
                            highlighting, shortcuts for code evaluation (i.e.,
                            live coding), and code completion.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Console Output</h3>

                        <p>
                            The Console Output shows the output messages
                            generated when Csound runs.{" "}
                        </p>

                        <h3>Play Controls</h3>

                        <p>
                            The Play controls include a Play/Pause button, Stop
                            button, and target selection. Each Web-IDE supports
                            using different CSDs as Run targets. This allows you
                            to create a project with multiple CSDs that share
                            code. Use the &quot;Configure&quot; command in the
                            target dropdown to manage targets for your project.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Social Controls</h3>

                        <p>
                            The social controls provide a button to share the
                            project via Facebook, Twitter, and Email; a Star
                            button to like the project; and an eye button to
                            mark the project as public or private. If you are
                            not the author of the project the eye button will
                            not be available, but you may still share or like
                            the project.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Csound Manual Panel</h3>

                        <p>
                            The Web-IDE provides a built-in version of the
                            Csound Manual that you can search through. Examples
                            found in manual entries can also be auditioned
                            directly in the manual panel.
